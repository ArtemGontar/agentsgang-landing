# User Story: Join Waitlist CTA

**As a** potential ProtoHive user
**I want** to see "Join Waitlist" instead of "Sign In" or "Start Free" CTAs
**So that** I can register my interest and be notified when ProtoHive launches

## Acceptance Criteria
- All "Sign In" and "Start Free" buttons/links are replaced with "Join Waitlist".
- Waitlist page or modal allows email submission.
- Confirmation message is shown after joining the waitlist.
