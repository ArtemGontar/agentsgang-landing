# User Story: Valid Navigation Links

**As a** visitor to the ProtoHive landing page
**I want** all navigation and footer links to lead to valid, existing pages (not 404s or anchors)
**So that** I can easily find information and have a seamless browsing experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- All links in the header, footer, and body point to real pages or a clear "Coming Soon" message.
- New pages are created for About, Blog, Careers, Contact, Help, Community, Tutorials, Case Studies, Privacy, Terms, Security, GDPR, Docs, API, and Pricing as needed.
- Anchor links are replaced with real pages or sections.
