# Feature Enhancement: Landing Page Improvements (June 2025)

## Overview
This feature introduces a set of enhancements to the ProtoHive public landing page to improve user experience, navigation, trust, and visual appeal. The changes address navigation issues, add a custom 404 page, update CTAs, enhance trust elements, introduce a dark theme, clarify pricing links, and update copyright information.

## Enhancements

1. **Navigation & Link Improvements**
   - All links that currently lead to 404 pages or anchor links will be updated to point to valid, existing pages. New pages will be created as needed:
     - `/about` — About ProtoHive, company mission, and team.
     - `/blog` — Company blog with news, updates, and articles.
     - `/careers` — Careers page with open positions and company culture.
     - `/contact` — Contact form for general inquiries.
     - `/help` — Help Center with FAQs and support resources.
     - `/community` — Community page for user forums and discussions.
     - `/tutorials` — Tutorials and guides for using ProtoHive.
     - `/case-studies` — Case studies and success stories.
     - `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/security`, `/gdpr` — Legal and compliance pages.
     - `/docs` — Product documentation.
     - `/api` — API documentation (or coming soon page).
     - `/pricing` — Pricing page (coming soon).
     - `/login`, `/signup` — Will be replaced by waitlist (see below).

2. **Custom 404 Page**
   - A custom 404 page will be designed in the style of the ProtoHive website, featuring brand colors, illustration, and a clear CTA to return to the homepage or explore other sections.

3. **Update CTAs: Join Waitlist**
   - Replace all instances of "Sign In" and "Start Free" with "Join Waitlist". The waitlist page will allow users to submit their email to be notified when ProtoHive launches.

4. **Social Proof Section Enhancement**
   - Improve the appearance of the "Trusted by startups and enterprises" section with:
     - Realistic company logos (if available) or visually appealing placeholders.
     - Enhanced layout, spacing, and animation for credibility.
     - Optional: Add a short testimonial or trust badge.

5. **Dark Theme Support**
   - Implement a dark theme for the landing page, allowing users to toggle between light and dark modes. The dark theme will use the brand's dark palette and ensure accessibility and visual consistency.

6. **Pricing Links: Coming Soon**
   - All links related to pricing (including plan CTAs and pricing navigation) will display a "Coming Soon" message or modal, rather than leading to a new page or form.

7. **Contact Sales Placement**
   - In the FAQ section, move the "Have questions about pricing or features? Contact sales" prompt above the "View FAQ" button for better visibility and conversion.

8. **Update Copyright**
   - Change all instances of "© 2024 ProtoHive. All rights reserved." to "© 2025 ProtoHive. All rights reserved."
