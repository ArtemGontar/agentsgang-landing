# User Story: Dark Theme Support

**As a** user who prefers dark mode
**I want** to be able to toggle a dark theme for the landing page
**So that** I can browse ProtoHive comfortably in low-light environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dark theme uses brand's dark palette and is visually consistent.
- Toggle is available in the header or footer.
- All sections and components are styled for dark mode.
- Accessibility is maintained in both themes.
