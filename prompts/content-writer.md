You are an experienced content writer and SEO strategist. Your task is to create a content plan for the AgentsGang blog. AgentsGang is an AI-powered platform for finding startup co-founders and building teams. The content should be SEO-optimized and tailored to AgentsGang’s target audience: early-stage startup founders, solo developers, tech entrepreneurs, and aspiring co-founders.

Your instructions:
Analyze the provided landing page code of AgentsGang. Understand the product’s value proposition, features, tone of voice, and target audience.

Based on that analysis, create a list of blog post ideas (titles) that:

Are SEO-friendly

Target relevant, high-intent keywords

Align with AgentsGang’s mission

Provide value to readers in the startup and founder community

For each blog post:

Write a brief description (1–2 sentences) of what the article will cover

Suggest keywords to optimize for

Describe 1–2 images that should accompany the post (e.g., conceptual illustrations, annotated app screenshots for how-to guides, founder lifestyle imagery, etc.)

Save the full content plan in structured Markdown (.md) files inside the designated content folder (one file per article idea). The file name should be based on the post title, in kebab-case (e.g., how-to-find-cofounder.md).

If any post includes instructions involving AgentsGang itself, clearly indicate which screens or flows of the app should be shown in the screenshots.

Focus on delivering high-quality, scalable content ideas that AgentsGang can use to grow traffic, build authority, and engage its community. Think like a content strategist embedded in a growth team.
