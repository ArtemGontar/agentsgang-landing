# Mini AI Company SaaS

## Short Description
Create and manage mini AI-powered companies with specialized agents that collaborate, use tools, remember context, and generate documentation â€” all in a SaaS platform.

## Long Description
This SaaS application enables users to build and manage their own mini companies staffed by AI agents with defined roles such as marketer, developer, analyst, and more. Each agent operates through a chat interface, equipped with specific tools and memory to handle assigned tasks autonomously.

Users can create organizations, add agents with roles, assign tasks, and interact with agents in real-time. Agents leverage integrated APIs and tools (code execution, web search, image generation, document editing) to perform their jobs efficiently, while maintaining individual and shared memory contexts.

All agent actions, conversations, and generated artifacts (documents, code, notes) are logged and stored, allowing automatic documentation and progress tracking. The platform supports multi-organization management, role-based access control, and subscription billing.
