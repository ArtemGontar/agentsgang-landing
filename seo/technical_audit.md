**Audit Date:** 2025-06-18

This document outlines the findings of a technical SEO audit conducted on the AgentsGang landing page. The goal is to identify areas for improvement to enhance search engine visibility, crawlability, and user experience.

## 1. Meta Tags & On-Page SEO

### 1.1. Title & Description
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** The `title` and `description` in `app/layout.tsx` are well-crafted, keyword-rich, and within optimal length limits. They effectively communicate the value proposition.

### 1.2. Open Graph & Twitter Cards
- **Status:** ⚠️ **Needs Improvement**
- **Analysis:** The Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata is correctly implemented. However, the specified social sharing image (`/og-image.png`) is missing from the `/public` directory, which will cause errors when sharing links on social media.
- **Recommendation:** Create and add an `og-image.png` (1200x630px) to the `/public` directory.

### 1.3. Keywords Meta Tag
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** A relevant list of keywords is included. While the `keywords` meta tag has minimal impact on modern search engine rankings, it doesn't hurt.

### 1.4. Headings Structure (H1, H2, etc.)
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** The page uses a logical heading structure. The main page (`app/page.tsx`) implicitly uses a single `<h1>` (the logo in the header, which links to home) and subsequent sections use `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags correctly, which helps search engines understand the content hierarchy. The `not-found.tsx` page also has a good heading structure.

### 1.5. Language Declaration
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** The language is correctly declared as English (`<html lang="en">`).

## 2. Crawlability & Indexability

### 2.1. `robots.txt`
- **Status:** ✅ **Done**
- **Analysis:** There is no `robots.txt` file in the `/public` directory. This file is essential for guiding search engine crawlers on which parts of the site to crawl or ignore.
- **Recommendation:** Create a `public/robots.txt` file to allow crawling of all content and specify the location of the sitemap.

### 2.2. `sitemap.xml`
- **Status:** ✅ **Done**
- **Analysis:** A `sitemap.xml` file is not present. A sitemap is crucial for helping search engines discover and index all pages on the site, especially as more pages (like a blog) are added.
- **Recommendation:** Create a `sitemap.ts` file in the `app/` directory to dynamically generate a `sitemap.xml` for all static and future dynamic pages.

### 2.3. Canonical URLs
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** Next.js automatically handles canonical URLs for pages, and the `metadataBase` URL is correctly set in `app/layout.tsx`. This prevents duplicate content issues.

## 3. Performance & User Experience

### 3.1. Core Web Vitals
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** The use of Next.js and Vercel provides a strong foundation for good Core Web Vitals. The use of `@next/font` for font optimization and `next/image` for image optimization are best practices. The dark mode script is placed in the head to prevent flashing, which is good for user experience.

### 3.2. Mobile Friendliness
- **Status:** ✅ **Good**
- **Analysis:** The site uses Tailwind CSS and a responsive design, ensuring it is mobile-friendly.

### 3.3. Internal Linking
- **Status:** ⚠️ **Needs Improvement**
- **Analysis:** The header navigation links work correctly. However, the footer links are empty placeholders. A well-structured footer with links to key pages is important for both users and SEO.
- **Recommendation:** Populate the footer with links to all the existing pages (`/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, etc.).

## 4. Schema Markup & Structured Data

### 4.1. Schema Implementation
- **Status:** ❌ **Missing**
- **Analysis:** The site does not currently use any Schema.org structured data. This is a missed opportunity to provide search engines with more context about the business and content.
- **Recommendation:**
    - Implement `Organization` schema on the main layout.
    - Implement `WebSite` schema with Sitelinks Search Box potential.
    - Implement `FAQPage` schema for the FAQ section to make these questions eligible for rich snippets in search results.

## Summary of Recommendations

1.  **High Priority (Quick Wins):**
    - **Done** Create `public/robots.txt`.
    - **Done** Create `app/sitemap.ts` to generate `sitemap.xml`.
    - Add the missing `public/og-image.png`.
    - Populate the empty links in the `Footer` component.

2.  **Medium Priority:**
    - Implement `Organization`, `WebSite`, and `FAQPage` schema markup (JSON-LD).

3.  **Low Priority:**
    - Replace the placeholder Google verification code in `app/layout.tsx` with the actual one from Google Search Console.
